This was made to be used with Crispy Hexen 5.5 which is the latest build I was able to find. The last official
build on fabiangreffrath's Github is 3.3, so you have to download that and then replace the executable with the
newer one.

Links at the bottom!

It almost certainly won't work with 3.3 or earlier versions, but I haven't tried so who knows. Might get lucky.

If you want to get this running on some other version throw me a PM and I'll have a look :)
